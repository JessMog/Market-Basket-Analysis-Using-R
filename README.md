Frequent itemset mining / Association analysis. -Data mining technique

## Overview
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique that analyzes patterns of co-occurrence and determines the strength of the link between products purchased together. We also refer to it as frequent itemset mining or association analysis. It leverages these patterns recognized in any retail setting to understand the behavior of the customer by identifying the relationships between the items bought by them. To put it simply, market basket analysis helps the retailers know about the products frequently bought together so as to keep those items always available in their inventory.
## Key Concepts

- Support: The proportion of transactions containing an itemset.
- Confidence: The probability of buying a consequent itemset (B) given the purchase of an antecedent itemset (A).
